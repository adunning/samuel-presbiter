In a casual conversation on medieval theology, the seven deadly sins are among the topics most likely to arise. Hugh of St Victor's *De quinque septenis* (*On the Five Sevens*) is a letter addressed to an unknown monastic showing how this widely known but insufficiently understood scheme was applied in the high medieval period. Hugh links the vices with four other groups of seven: the requests of the Lord's Prayer (using the version in Matthew 6:9–13), the gifts of the Holy Spirit (based on Isaiah 11:2–3), the virtues, and the beatitudes (Matt. 5:3–9) [all biblical references follow @weber:2007biblia: note that the beatitudes occur in a slightly different order from most English Bibles, and the Septuagint/Vulgate numeration of the Psalms differs from that of the Hebrew]. Its accessibility and consistent schematization made it appealing to anyone wishing to teach these subjects, and it was widely copied for the remainder of the Middle Ages [one hundred manuscripts are listed in @goy:1976überlieferung, pp. 368–383; see also @bloomfield:1979incipits, pp. 407–408 (no. 4833); @newhauser:2008supplement, p. 275]. Later writers also adapted its contents to present it in new ways, of which Samuel Presbiter's *De oratione dominica* is one such example, written around the turn of the thirteenth century.

*De quinque septenis* has been printed many times; this article presents a documentary edition of Paris, Bibliothèque Mazarine, MS 717, representing the edition of Abbot Gilduin made shortly after Hugh's death. *De oratione dominica* has never been studied or published, and survives in a single manuscript from Bury St Edmunds that was likely corrected by its author, now Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 115. Both works are here presented for the first time with an English translation.

# Hugh of St Victor

Hugh of St Victor (ca. 1096–1141) was an Augustinian regular canon at the Abbey of Saint Victor in Paris [for a summary of Hugh's ambiguous origins, see @rorem:2009hugh, pp. 9–11; @poirel:2006hugo]. He is best known for his *Didascalicon*, an introduction to the art and purpose of reading [@buttimer:1939hugonis; English: @taylor:1961didascalicon; French: @lemoine:1991hugues; German: @offergeld:1997hugo; Italian: @sannelli:2011ugo], *De sacramentis* (*On the Sacraments*), a forerunner to the systematizing *summae* of the scholastic theologians [@berndt:2008hugonis; English: @deferrari:1951sacraments; German: @knauer:2010hugo], and his innovative use of Noah's Ark as a teaching aid [@rudolph:2014mystic; @sicard:2001hugonis; @sicard:1993diagrammes]. Unlike many medieval authors, he has been read continuously since his own time, with his works successfully navigating manuscript transmission, the printing press, and modernism. This success can be attributed in part to an organization that provided sustained promotion for his work – the Augustinian abbey of Saint Victor in Paris, founded in Hugh's youth and surviving until its destruction during the French Revolution. The realization that our understanding of Hugh cannot be separated from his institutional context has produced something of a renaissance in studies on the Victorines and their school [recent scholarship on this is summarized in @berndt:2011writings].

## *De quinque septenis*

*De quinque septenis* is thought to have been written ca. 1130/31–1137 [@vandeneynde:1960essai, p. 215]. It presents itself as a letter to an anonymous fellow monastic, responding to a specific request for an explanation of five groups of seven phenomena Hugh identifies in scripture. It is difficult to deduce anything concerning the situation in which this arose: nothing in the tone indicates whether it was a topic that arose in casual conversation with a friend, or an enquiry from a distant correspondent pressing for further detail on the subject. Roger Baron suggests that the letter was a logical outgrowth from Hugh's earlier work *De institutione nouitiorum* [@baron:1959hugues, p. 276–278]. The essay is an effective and focused tool for teaching and internalizing a small but practical aspect of salvation.

Hugh presents the five identified groups of seven as having an integral and logical relationship both within their own families and with the others, the vices successively breaking apart the person, which only God can amend [summarized in more detail in @coolman:2010theology, pp. 69–73; @coolman:2007hugh]. While Hugh claims that his subjects come from scripture, this is only loosely true of the vices, which occur in scripture but not together: their assembly is the result of a longer tradition beginning with Evagrius Ponticus and John Cassian [@newhauser:2009capital; @newhauser:1993treatise, pp. 180–202]. The approach of taking the vices as a connected whole, popularized by Gregory the Great, is now termed the "concatenation" model [*Moralia in Iob* 31.45: @adriaen:1979gregorii, pp. 143b:1610–1613; @wenzel:1968seven, p. 4], and Hugh reused it in later works [e.g. *De sacramentis* 2.13.1: @berndt:2008hugonis, p. 481–483; *Scala celi*, edited in @baron:1963études, pp. 219–255]. Each of the vices is a direct result of the one preceding it, with pride as the root of them all and lust as their end, in a list that differed slightly from earlier inventories [for a comparison of Hugh's categories with Augustine, Paschasius Radbertus, and Gregory the Great, see @rehm:1994bebilderte, pp. 7–14]:

1. Superbia/Pride
2. Inuidia/Envy
3. Ira/Anger
4. Tristitia/Sadness
5. Auaritia/Greed
6. Gula/Gluttony
7. Luxuria/Lust

In the meantime, the seven requests of the Lord's Prayer directly combat the vices (Matt. 6:9–13):

1. Sanctificetur nomen tuum/Hallowed be your name
2. Adueniat regnum tuum/Your kingdom come
3. Fiat uoluntas tua sicut in caelo et in terra/Your will be done, on earth as in heaven
4. Panem nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie/Give us today our daily bread
5. Dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris/Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors
6. Ne nos inducas in temptationem/Lead us not into temptation
7. Libera nos a malo/Deliver us from evil

In response to these, God provides seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, from Isaiah 11:2–3:

1. Spiritus timoris domini/Spirit of the fear of the Lord
2. Spiritus pietatis/Spirit of godliness
3. Spiritus scientiae/Spirit of knowledge
4. Spiritus fortitudinis/Spirit of strength
5. Spiritus consilii/Spirit of counsel
6. Spiritus intellectus/Spirit of understanding
7. Spiritus sapientiae/Spirit of wisdom

These produce seven virtues, based on the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5:3–9:

1. Paupertas spiritus (humilitas)/Poverty of spirit (humility)
2. Mansuetudo (benignitas)/Graciousness (kindness)
3. Compunctio (dolor)/Remorse (sorrow)
4. Esuries iustitiae (desiderium bonum)/Hunger for justice (good desire)
5. Misericordia/Mercy
6. Munditia cordis/Cleanness of heart
7. Pax/Peace

Finally, these result in the corresponding beatitudes of the same passage from Matthew:

1. Regnum caelorum/Kingdom of heaven
2. Possessio terrae uiuentium/Possession of the land of the living
3. Consolatio/Consolation
4. Iustitiae saturitas/Satisfaction of justice
5. Misericordia/Mercy
6. Visio dei/Vision of God
7. Filiatio dei/Sonship of God

Most readers would likely count eight or nine beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5:3–12): Hugh's numeration of seven follows Augustine in *De sermo domini in monte* (*On the Sermon of the Lord on the Mount*), who argues that the eighth beatitude is merely a summary of the first seven; the ninth is not to be taken with the rest, since it dispenses with the impersonal construction and there is no specific blessing [*De sermo domini in monte* 1.10: @mutzenbecher:1967sancti, pp. 7–9]. He links these directly to the gifts of the Holy Spirit [*De sermo domini in monte* 1.11–12: @mutzenbecher:1967sancti, pp. 9–13]. It is only natural that when he reaches the Lord's Prayer in his discussion of the Sermon on the Mount, he also links these petitions to his seven beatitudes [*De sermo domini in monte* 2.38: @mutzenbecher:1967sancti, pp. 128–130]. Four of the five groups Hugh discusses had a precedent. It has been noted that he might also have been inspired by one of the versions of the *Glosa* on Matthew, most versions of which reflect Augustine's approach [@lottin:1957doctrine, pp. 290–291], but Hugh almost certainly had direct access to Augustine's work, since the abbey owned a copy written in the early twelfth century [@ouy:1999manuscrits, p. 2:198 (CC 2)].

While Hugh's use of numbers might seem artificial to a modern audience – Hauréau, an influential nineteenth-century commentator on Hugh, derided him as "le Pythagore des théologiens" [@hauréau:1886œuvres, p. 22] – their deployment as a mnemonic was common in the Middle Ages. Far from perfunctorily using numbers, Hugh applied them in a particularly practical and rigorous manner for improving the memory. In *De tribus maximis circumstantiis gestorum*, he encouraged students to use numbers mapped onto a grid to promote a spacial understanding of a subject, a particularly innovative and effective approach [@green:1943hugo; translated in @carruthers:2008book, pp. 339–344].

Hugh left a clear system for remembering and applying five of the key medieval devotional schemes, and it gained new relevance with the rise of new texts for pastoral care leading up to and following the Fourth Lateran Council [see @boyle:1986interconciliar; @diem:2004virtues]. With this, Hugh's text was supplied with new visual and oral methods for presenting and memorizing its contents. Samuel Presbiter's *De oratione dominica* is one example of a paraphrase to promote memorization. One also finds a series of circular diagrams or *rotae* that originated in the late twelfth century, some translated into the vernacular, some of which were directly influenced by Hugh [@rehm:1994bebilderte, pp. 20–26, 72–77]; one called by scholars the *Septenarium pictum* survives in at least a dozen copies [@taylor:2013present, pp. 8–16]. These acted as a supplement to Hugh's text rather than replacing it, and new manuscript copies continued to be made until the end of the medieval period. The influence of *De quinque septenis* can be traced even in Thomas Aquinas [@sweeney:2012aquinas, pp. 99-101], and it continued to appeal to the reformers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries [@rehm:1994bebilderte, pp. 19–21; @edstam:2014twelfthcentury, pp. 198–207; @newhauser:2009capital, p. 118].

## Abbot Gilduin's Edition of Hugh and Paris, Bibliothèque Mazarine, MS 717

It is possible that *De quinque septenis* might not have circulated much further than its original recipient were it not for an edition created of Hugh's works after his death in 1141 by Abbot Gilduin [see @stammberger:2005edition; @poirel:2002livre, pp. 27–86]. The existence of this effort and its results are documented by the *Indiculum* listing Hugh's works in Oxford, Merton College, MS 49, where *De quinque septenis* is mentioned under that title [@deghellinck:1910table, p. 280 (fol. 82r)]. It has become increasingly apparent that this edition was enormously influential in establishing the form and contents of Hugh's corpus, and in promoting its dissemination. It is also a useful basis for understanding Hugh's thought within his historical context. Paul Rorem has written a successful introduction to Hugh by working through his major works in the order they appear in the *Indiculum* [@rorem:2009hugh, pp. 13–14]. An effort is now underway to recreate the text of this edition [@berndt:2008hugonis, p. 15].

One of the most important textual witnesses to *De quinque septenis* is a source contemporary with Gilduin: Paris, Bibliothèque Mazarine, MS 717. It originally belonged to the Abbey of Saint Victor, appearing in the sixteenth-century catalogue by Claude de Grandrue [@ouy:1999manuscrits, 2:256–257 (HH 1)]. Baron noted its correlation with the *Indiculum* [@baron:1956étude, pp. 189–190], but he and other earlier commentators believed that the book was from the early thirteenth century [@baron:1956étude, p. 183]. More recently, Patricia Stirnemann dated it palaeographically to 1141–50 [@stirnemann:1994où, pp. 273, 284n64; @giraud:2010rayonnement, p. 655]. Poirel argues that it was a direct copy from the original manuscripts produced under Gilduin, providing a full codicological description [@poirel:2002livre, pp. 37–49, with contents listed in appendix 1, 427–45], and Stammberger compares it extensively with the *Indiculum* [@stammberger:2005edition, pp. 123–136].

The text of *De quinque septenis* found on fols. 210va–212rb is written in a single protogothic hand. The scribe usually joins prepositions such as "ab" to the following word. The text is moderately abbreviated, but the scribe usually writes out "anima" and "dominus" rather than using the standard contractions. It is contained within a single gathering: the catchword on fol. 211v was used for assembling the gathering, and does not indicate its end [see the collation in @poirel:2002livre, p. 40]. It opens with a blue two-line capital, with red tracery. A small amount of red ink matching the shade of the initial on fol. 212rb has been spilled on fol. 211ra. It has been corrected by at least one reader, distinguished by a hand with thin strokes. This might be a contemporary corrector working with the scribe, as most of the ninth line on fol. 211rb (beginning "subueniat saluatoris") has been erased and rewritten in what appears to be the same hand, compressed in order to fit into the limited space. One paragraph mark has been added in the margin in plummet on fol. 210vb, dividing what could be conceived as the introduction from the rest of the work. A later annotator (designated B in the edition) has added six inline paragraph marks in addition to running labels in the margins highlighting the numbers in the text, and flags several key passages with a set of three dots and a vertical line.

## Editing *De quinque septenis*

*De quinque septenis* was first printed in 1474 or slightly earlier [@hugodesanctovictore:1474didascalicon, fols. 85r–88r of the final part of the volume, "Sententię vel assertiones Hugonis lucidissimę, in quibusdam verbis diuinis, et rerum naturis."]. It was published by Stephanus in 1506 [@clichtove:1506hoc, fols. 87v–91r], breaking the work somewhat arbitrarily into four chapters. It was edited only in part, as *Annotationes elucidatoriae testamenti noui* 2.15, in the collections of Hugh's works published in 1526 and 1648 [@1526primo, fol. 211v; @abbeyofstvictorparis:1648hugonis, p. 1:303; I have been unable to consult the versions of 1588 and 1617: on the relationship between the various early-modern editions of Hugh, see @quantin:2010réception]. In 1836, it was published as *S. Augustini Epistola de septem petitionibus in Pater noster*, with the editors arguing for the attribution on the basis of its similarity to Augustine's *De sermone domini in monte* 2.38 [@caillau:1836sancti, pp. 160–162; their text is printed from Monte Cassino, MS 387, pp. 377–87, described in @inguanez:1915codicum, p. 2:253]. It appeared in the Patrologia Latina (PL) series as *De quinque septenis seu septenariis opusculum* [@migne:1854hugonis, 175:405–410] with Hugh's *De septem donis spiritus sancti* added as a fifth chapter [@migne:1854hugonis, 175:410–414]. It was most recently published by Baron in a critical edition using seven manuscripts, taking the Mazarine manuscript as a base text [@baron:1969hugues, pp. 100–118, introduction 30–37].

Baron's apparatus does not accurately report variants from the Mazarine manuscript: he indicates that it reads "ad inuicem" at fol. 210va rather than "abinuicem" (a variant he ascribes only to Va), "ipsi" (the reading of the PL) at fol. 211ra rather than "sibi" (not reported as a variant), and "docetur" at fol. 211vb rather than "donatur" (which he ascribes only to Va, H, and L). He arbitrarily classicizes many spellings. While his text superficially follows the punctuation of the manuscript, he freely modifies it, often detrimentally: for instance, on fol. 210vb, the sentence "Cur nisi … amittat" ends not with Baron's question mark but more correctly with a simple *punctus*; Hugh has finished his interrogation of pride, and is now stating the force of its destruction. The edition was published posthumously [@baron:1969hugues, p. 41], and some of these errors might not have occurred had Baron lived to see it through the press. While his choice of manuscript is good, it has more unique and potentially correct readings than he shows.

The present edition emends the manuscript only where required for sense. Only a few significant modifications to the text are necessary. At fol. 210vb, "se" is suppressed in "ab illuminante se auertitur", reported by Baron as occurring only in the Mazarine manuscript. While it can be found in at least one other witness [Monte Cassino, MS 387, as printed in @caillau:1836sancti, p. 161], the usage of the previous sentence indicates that this is an error. At fol. 211ra, "quatum" is replaced with "quantum", and at fol. 211va, "uenerati" with "uenerari": these corrections are also made by Baron but not reported. Prepositions are separated where appropriate in the regularized form of the edition.

# Samuel Presbiter

Samuel Presbiter (fl. 1200) is known to history only through the preservation of his works in two volumes from the abbey library of Bury St Edmunds, now Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 115 and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 860 (*SC* 2723). His writings largely excerpt and versify earlier prose works. *De oratione dominica* is a versification of Hugh's *De quinque septenis*. Extracts from Hugh's prose are copied between the verses as a commentary, a format Samuel uses in several of his works. The change in title reflects a shift in focus. While the verses summarize each of the groups of five, there is a stronger focus on the Lord's Prayer, and its worthy (*digna*) invocation. The result is an epitome of Hugh's work, removing the frame of a letter, presenting the source material from the Sermon on the Mount more explicitly, and providing a series of verses that could be memorized in order to recall the full contents of the whole.

All that is certainly known of Samuel's life is his claim to have studied under William de Montibus, who taught at the cathedral school in Lincoln from the 1180s until some point before his death in 1213 [@dunning:2015samuel, p. 2; on William's life and works, see @goering:1992william]. There are only a few possible references to him in documentary sources; he might be identifiable with the "Samuel de Ounebi" (Owmby by Spital, in Lincolnshire) who witnessed a charter alongside William de Montibus between 1196 and 1203 [@foster:1931registrum, pp. 4:32–33 (nos. 1140/41)]. A "mansionem Samuelis" is recorded in Owmby by Spital around 1200–1210 [@foster:1931registrum, p. 4:31 (no. 1138)]. The name Presbiter, which is unusual but attached to others in the city of Lincoln, was sometimes used to translate the name "Cohen", leading to a suggestion that Samuel may have been a Jewish convert, or from a family of converts [@goering:1992william, p. 45n68; @foster:1931registrum, p. 3:200 makes the same assumption of a Samuel Presbiter living in Huntingdon; @piperollsociety:1900feet, p. 71 (no. 104) records him there in 1198]. Given that both of the manuscripts containing Samuel's works are from Bury St Edmunds, the author might also have been associated with the abbey, which fostered a community of learning under Samson, abbot from 1182 until 1211 [@gransden:2007history, pp. 135–36].

*De oratione dominica* is likely one of Samuel's earlier works. He labels most of his writings "collecta" ("things gathered" or "compiled"), most combining verses with a prose commentary. Two works, probably his earliest, are entirely in prose [this list is adapted from @dunning:2015samuel, p. 6]:

- *Collecta ex auditis super psalmos in scola magistri Willelmi de Monte*/*Things gathered from things heard on the Psalms in the school of master William de Montibus* (Bodley 860, fols. 9r–93v), an incomplete commentary on the Psalms [@goering:1992william, pp. 501–503, prints the text of fol. 9r]
- *Collecta ex speculo beati Gregorii sine uersibus*/*Things gathered from the Speculum of blessed Gregory, without verses* (Pembroke College 115, fols. 47r–77r)

In most of his works, both verses and prose were copied together, the prose often an extract from another work to show precisely what Samuel is versifying, and written directly above the verses to which it applies. These include:

- *Collecta ex diuersis auditis in scola magistri Willelmi de Monte*/*Things gathered from various things heard in the school of master William de Montibus* (Bodley 860, fols. 94r–107v)
- *Collecta ex speculo beati Gregorii cum uersibus*/*Things gathered from the Speculum of blessed Gregory, with verses* (Pembroke College 115, fols. 1r–41v)
- the present work, *De oratione dominica*/*On the Lord's Prayer* (Pembroke College 115, fols. 41v–44v)
- four short compositions (Pembroke College 115, fols. 45r–46r), with the incipits:
    1. "Est proprium domini mentem bene pacificare" (*8 lines*)
    2. "Est uagus hic cuius animus non recta cupiscit" (*2 lines*)
    3. "Flos bonus est actus hoc est spes fulgor odorque" (*12 lines*)
    4. "Multiplex hominis pacientia dicitur esse", entitled "De patientia" (*2 lines*)

In two works that are probably among his latest, the verses stand on their own, with glosses added in the margins:

- *Collecta ad habendam memoriam quorumdam utilium in sacra scriptura*/*Things gathered for remembering various useful things in sacred scripture* (Bodley 860, fols. 108r–206v) [listed alongside other works of this genre in @dinkovabruun:2007biblical, pp. 333, 339–340]
- a verse paraphrase of Psalm 1 (Bodley 860, fols. 1r–8v) [edited in part by @dinkovabruun:2009samuel, pp. 157–161]

The only overt indicators of chronology for these works are that *Ex auditis super psalmos* and *Ex diuersis auditis* reflect Samuel's studies under William de Montibus, while *Ad habendam memoriam* was written after he left the school, according to the extended heading with which the work begins. The two *Ex speculo* works abridge the *Speculum Gregorii*, Adalbert of Metz's epitome of Gregory the Great's *Moralia in Iob* [unedited, but studied in @valgimogli:2006speculum]; many copies of it existed in England, including one at Bury St Edmunds by the late twelfth century [@sharpe:1996english, B13.48a]. Samuel also refers to it in his paraphrase of Psalm 1 (for example, Bodley 860, fols. 4r, 5r) and *Ad habendam memoriam* (fols. 128v, 130r). These works are also his most mature: the marginal glosses reflect increased confidence to work directly with biblical texts as well as secondary theological works, and often amalgamate references to many titles rather than summarize a single source.

## *De oratione dominica*

The verses of *De oratione dominica* are written in hexameter and organized into eight stanzas: one introductory, and one for each of the requests in the Lord's Prayer. These summarize the entirety of Hugh's system of five groups, typically beginning with an indication of which vice the request addresses, followed by the gift of the Holy Spirit given in response, the corresponding virtue that comes from this, and the resulting beatitude. In Samuel's other writings, verses are frequently presented to be memorized in order to learn the details of a particular concept, and the intent is presumably the same for this work.

As the title suggests, Samuel shifts the primary focus to the Lord's Prayer, with a subtle reforming stance. Hugh presents the prayer as the first step towards their elimination, and arguably the only one for which humans are truly responsible: but he begins with the vices, which rhetorically puts the emphasis on understanding the effects of the vices and how one might rid oneself of them. Samuel introduces a new emphasis in his verses: that the prayer must be *digna*, "worthy" or "appropriate". When a person presents the prayer, everything else follows naturally, as long as it is done wholeheartedly and solemnly. "Et bene sonato felicia gaudia confert" (fol. 44v) – "And when he speaks well, he gathers the blessed joys."

The commentary to the verses is a direct abridgement of *De quinque septenis*, reorganizing the text to made it and adding in quotations of the Beatitudes. Samuel eliminates most of the details of the discussion concerning the effects of the vices, although after quoting Hugh's basic definitions of their correlation, these are repeated throughout the text for easier reference above the corresponding verse. The emphasis is placed on understanding the practical workings of the Lord's Prayer, and not on the effects of vice, which are arguably much more visible. Connecting words such as *ergo* are usually removed. The cumulative effect of these changes is to transform Hugh's work into a more efficient and direct treatise that could be quickly internalized. The annotations to Mazarine 717 indicate that readers found Hugh's text difficult to navigate for reference purposes, and a could memorize Samuel's verses to remember the system, and use the book when necessary to find the most useful passages.

In many ways, *De oratione dominica* would be most helpful to someone who had already read Hugh's text. Yet while it can be seen from the list of Samuel's works, that he is normally careful to cite the sources he uses, *De oratione dominica* is an exception: he does not give any indication that it is copied from another source. This is typical of the intellectual culture of the Middle Ages, in which there was immense freedom to adapt the writings of others. This sometimes leaves today's readers, unfamiliar with the writings of the period, with the concern that medieval writers intended to pass off the work of others as original. It might be argued that Samuel's audience would have been so familiar with the work that they would recognize the source immediately. He might have had access to a copy of *De quinque septenis* at either Lincoln or Bury St Edmunds: three copies of the work survive in the library of Lincoln Cathedral, two from the twelfth century and one from the thirteenth [@thomson:1989catalogue, pp. 41 (no. 58, art. 6.18), 163 (no. 201, art. 71), 201 (no. 241, art. 9)]; Bury St Edmunds owned at least two copies, from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries [@james:1905descriptive, pp. 9 (no. 9), 83 (no. 90)]. In *Ex diuersis auditis*, Samuel's citations function to remind the reader of the authority of the texts he uses, and not to provide a location where the original might be found. He normally gives some form of attribution to biblical and classical sources, but the few references to works written within the preceding century are mostly integrated without comment. Hugh had been dead for little more than half a century when Samuel was writing, and his reputation was still rising. It was only the biblical sources that needed to be identified in order to communicate the subject at hand, and Samuel enhanced the citation of these over Hugh's original.

Whereas many of Samuel's other works were written in Leonines, which use an internal rhyming scheme, *De oratione dominica* is composed in unrhymed hexameter, usually but not always with a caesura in the third foot. The syntax is not complex. They are not particularly artful, but they are highly serviceable.

It is tempting to dismiss Samuel as a mere excerpter [@russell:1936dictionary, p. 147 (s.v. ‘Samuel Presbyter’)], or as Brian Twyne thought, little more than a devotee of William de Montibus ["Qui Gulielmi de Monte celeberrimi suo tempore Oxoniae theol. professoris auditor diligens et admirator extitit." Quoted in @tanner:1748bibliotheca, p. 651]. Samuel himself provides some idea of his motives behind his work. The opening folios of both Pembroke College, MS 115 and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 860 contain a text written as a *distinctio* in red ink, forming hexameter lines that can be read in four different ways:

![Distinction in Cambridge, Pembroke College 115, fol. 1r.](figures/pembroke-distinction-1r.jpg)

In the same format, both manuscripts have the following at the bottom of the last page of text (Bodley 860, fol. 206v; Pembroke College, MS 115, fol. 76r):

These passages are highly characteristic of Samuel's intellectual milieu. Their presence indicates that these two manuscripts were planned together in the form in which they have survived. These are collections of earlier units: Bodley 860 is a composite of three booklets, while Pembroke College 115 can be divided into two parts. Similar to the way in which Mazarine 717 represents a conscious effort to assemble the works of Hugh of St Victor, the Bury manuscripts are an attempt to provide Samuel's writings in a presentable form, in this case with the author's own involvement.

## Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 115

Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 115 [@james:1905descriptive, pp. 111–112] is written entirely on parchment in Latin, with pages measuring around 230 × 163 mm. A pressmark of "S. 2" on the upper flyleaf indicates its cataloguing in the abbey of Bury St Edmunds by the librarian Henry Kirkestede (ca. 1314–ca. 1378). This categorizes it with material that might have been used for preaching: S. 1 was a copy of Sallust, S. 18 Suetonius, and many of the later volumes were sermon collections [@sharpe:1998reconstructing, p. 214; @james:1926bury, p. 257]. Its sibling, now Bodley 860, was B. 233, placing it with commentaries on the Psalms. The manuscripts were among others from Bury bequeathed to Pembroke College by William Smart in 1599 [@james:1895abbey, pp. 15–16, prints Matthew Wren's list; for a summary of the Bury library's history, see @sharpe:1996english, pp. 43–49], Bodley 860 being one of thirty-one manuscripts separated from the Pembroke collection [listed in @james:1905descriptive, pp. xx–xxiii, where it is no. 2077; this follows its enumeration in @bernard:1697catalogi, which for Pembroke reprints the listing in @james:1600ecloga; @hunt:1895summary, no. 2723, conjectures that the Bodleian Library acquired the book in 1603 or 1604]. 

The volume is collated 1^8^–5^8^, 6^8–2^ (7/8 cancelled) || 7^8^–9^8^, 10^8–1^ (8 cancelled). The cancelled leaves between fols. 46 and 47 would presumably have been blank, as is fol. 46v: the contents are uninterrupted. The second booklet corresponds to *Collecta ex speculo beati Gregorii sine uersibus*, which has different ruling (in plummet rather than pencil) and a simpler scheme of decorated capitals from the rest of the volume. The same fashion of the final booklet of Bodley 860, the order of the internal pages of most gatherings are designated by letters, and a number (·i· through ·ix·) is found at the end of each gathering at the bottom of the page, in the centre, written in ink.

While the page layout is visually similar to Bodley 860, the ruling pattern differs slightly. In the Pembroke manuscript, the line spacing is variable, generally leaving 4.5 mm for prose and 7 mm for verses. This appears to have been done before the page was copied, and where this was not correctly planned, either the verse has to span two lines or a 7 mm line is subdivided for two shorter lines of prose. This can be seen, for example, on fol. 6r. The lines of the prose passages in Bodley 860 are similarly 4.5 mm high, but two full lines (9 to 10 mm) are left for the verses, simplifying the page preparation process.

The evidence suggests that Samuel was involved personally in the production of Pembroke College 115 and Bodley 860, with a correcting hand found in both manuscripts. This corrector is intimately familiar with the text, and seems to have gone through it methodically after it was copied; he leaves a faint note in the lower corner of MS Bodley 860, fol. 103r that reads "usque hunc in parte". Its contemporaneity is demonstrated by fol. 39r, where one also finds additional verses copied into the margin, in turn recopied by a contemporary scribe imitating the original hand. The correction has been trimmed in binding, and as the manuscript appears to be in its original medieval binding, this was probably done at the time of production. While this correction might have been caught by anyone working with the exemplar, the same hand also makes original revisions to the text. The corrector is also highly interested in detail, extensively revising the punctuation (often, for instance, changing a *punctus* to a *punctus eleuatus*). The most likely identity for this corrector is Samuel himself.

## Editing *De oratione dominica*

As Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 115, fols. 41v–44v is the sole witness to *De oratione dominica*, and it has never been previously edited, a documentary edition of this manuscript encapsules the full known history of this text. In this situation, one of the best things that an editor can do is to create an edition that can be cited in the same way as the manuscript. For instance, while Baron's edition of Mazarine 717 cites the folio and column breaks (though a few are missing), the only possible method of referring to a more specific passage in Hugh's text is to use the line numbers in Baron's own edition. Some scholars have instead chosen to refer to the Patrologia Latina columns (not included in Baron edition) and use Migne's text. By instead recording the position of line breaks in the manuscript, one can maintain the citation systems that already exist, and refrain from perpetuating a new scheme. This is, indeed, a necessity for the flexible layout of electronic texts, where stable references must refer either to a physical object or a semantic division.

One of the problems of *De oratione dominica* (like all of Samuel's verse-prose compilations) is that its layout does not fit with a key modern assumption of how a book should work: one cannot start reading at the top of the page and scan to the bottom. Instead, the text begins with the commentary, which is pared with the applicable line of verse below it. The commentary is far longer than the verses, meaning that the individual verse of the poem must be searched out over the entire text. In a printed version of this text, an editor would be forced to choose between rearranging the text to promote readability, and bringing the reader to the original – maintaining the ability to cite the manuscript by folio, the possibility of making better historical inferences about how readers might have used the text, and the prospect of experiencing non-linear habits of reading. This is only possible by relying on semantic categories rather than typographical conventions to interpret the text (for example, explicitly marking a line as verse rather than simply displaying it in enlarged type), and displaying the text in both documentary and regular forms. This is a distinct advantage of presenting texts in a digital format.

The verses of *De oratione dominica* are entirely sensible as corrected, but the prose requires several emendations. The text is slightly different from that of Mazarine 717, including a few variants recorded by Baron, though not corresponding to any one of his manuscripts. Like most manuscripts of this period, capital letters are used only to indicate the beginning of a sentence, but one of the challenges of the particular script is an ambiguity between majuscule and minuscule characters. Some of the distinctions identified in the edition are judgements based on sense rather than visual appearance.

# Methodology: Aligning Editions with Research Questions

After half a century of using computers in scholarly editing, classical and medieval historians have yet to agree on standards for what needs to be included in a digital edition. The focus tends to remain on adapting the standards of printed critical editions to a digital format, skipping the step of considering the specific technological restrictions and intellectual emphases that originally brought forth the peculiar format of the critical edition in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. If one examines this history, it quickly becomes apparent that applying the technological restrictions of the printing press is purely artificial, resulting in the complete lack of agreement as to how one should encode a critical apparatus in a digital format. Further, the vast number of important texts that still must be read in an early-modern edition shows the sheer impracticality of the recensionist ideal for editions, now exacerbated by an academic funding model that promotes short-term projects. There have long been calls for integrating codicology into editorial practices [@boyle:1976optimist]. A solution can be found in the principles of documentary editing, and superseding the critical apparatus by developing better ways to provide historical context by comparing textual variants.

The rationale for documentary editing in a digital context has already been stated [summarized by @pierazzo:2014digital], but there are not yet established guidelines for applying this to medieval Latin literary texts. Digital editing provides the ability to record information in an edition that might be useful to answering certain research questions but might otherwise inhibit the reading of a text. Further, as shown in the case of *De oratione dominica*, common and explicit terminology forces editors to be clearer about their interpretations rather than ask readers to infer meaning from devices of punctuation and layout that can be interpreted according to many different conventions.

Yet this removal of the limitations of print also means that it is necessary to set new boundaries for oneself. Due to the incredible uniqueness of handwritten sources, there is no limit to the amount of information one can record about them, and there is correspondingly a vast number of tags available as part of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) that many editors will never need, but their presence raises the question of whether they are necessary. Editors are told that TEI guidelines should be applied in the way that best fits their research questions – but editors work for others as much as themselves. If one wishes to produce texts that can be reused by other researchers and fit within larger corpora, the potential scope of research questions applying to premodern texts needs to be coordinated with the scribal practices one must interpret in editing manuscripts. Without a corpus of digital texts for study to which one can add one's work, and without any clear indication of how TEI elements can be analysed, it often happens that one only realizes during the process of editing that it would have been useful to have recorded a certain feature. The documentary editions of both Hugh's and Samuel's texts produced here are in part an experiment to determine what information can be practically and scientifically recorded from typical, relatively uncomplicated manuscripts, building off earlier studies of more complex phenomena [e.g. @pierazzo:2011putting].

In determining what should be encoded in editions of works from this period, the possible levels of detail were narrowed down to four layers corresponding to likely uses for the texts [for another approach, see @pierazzo:2011rationale]:

1. Basic transcription necessary to read and search the text of the manuscript, find significant variants in a collation with other witnesses, identify textual reuse, and perform basic stylometric analysis [e.g. @kestemont:2015collaborative]. To meet this need, markup may be light, sometimes even the result of a text produced from an old edition via optical character recognition (OCR) software. Spelling can be normalized, as there should be no expectation at this level of using such texts for fine-grained linguistic research, and editors of critical editions do not normally consider such differences to be noteworthy.
2. Information required to cite the text with precision and study minor variants between witnesses, including changes in spelling and punctuation. Any scribal modifications to the manuscript should be indicated. The edition encodes the position of line breaks to facilitate citation and verification, and follows original spelling as far as abbreviations allow, though it may be necessary to silently regularize word division to some extent. Punctuation and capitalization are regularized only if necessary; appropriate tags are used for indicating quotation rather than inserting quotation marks. As a matter of practicality, if one wishes to capitalize proper names in a reader's version (until late in the Middle Ages, it was common to use capitals only for first letter of a sentence), it is easiest to accomplish this by marking the words as names, which also allows the terms to be compiled in an index. Abbreviations may be silently expanded, though it may be helpful to record them in cases of ambiguity.
3. Information necessary to study the exact contemporary reading of the text and precise spelling, together with the scribe's linguistic profile [see @parkes:1994latin]: all of the above, mandating the preservation of the original punctuation, encoding editorial regularizations of hyphenation and word division, and documenting all expansions of abbreviations.
4. Information needed for statistical analysis of a scribe's graphic profile [e.g. @gobbitt:2012orthographic]: the above in addition to full encoding of abbreviation markers and unusual letterforms relevant for palaeographical study (e.g. round and long 's').

Most electronic editions available today would fall into the first category: they are still of far more use than nothing at all. Most new digital editions would probably fall into the second category: this is the point at which the most broadly useful features of the manuscript can recorded before the XML file starts to become too unwieldy to edit by hand. The third and fourth categories are more specialized, but represent real and useful research questions, and with better software these levels would become more easily achievable. It is much easier to upgrade a transcription from one level to another than to start afresh, and over time, scholars could build up one another's work through all these stages based on the problems they need to solve.

One could think of this approach in terms of restoring a building, or a work of art: when one edits a manuscript in a digital format, it is possible to carefully erect new walls without destroying the what is there, and years later it will still be possible for someone else to redecorate without cursing us for destroying the original fixtures. Rearranging a text for print is usually more akin to gutting a room and rebuilding it entirely to fit modern trends. At the same time, because one is creating a technology-independent edition that can have more than one possible layout rather than one tied precisely to the needs of paper, it is not necessary to sacrifice usability.

The present editions of *De quinque septenis* and *De oratione dominica* fall into the third category above, with the aim of better understanding the punctuation and spelling of this period. Similar to the most recent edition of Hugh's *De sacramentis* [@berndt:2008hugonis], these editions use the original punctuation from the manuscript. In order to track the spelling with precision, it was necessary to show precisely which letters were interpreted by the editor – a long-standing expectation for diplomatic editions of vernacular and some Latin texts. Words such as *Christus* are never spelled out in full in the text; although there is evidence to suggest that *Cristus* was the most common spelling in England of the thirteenth-century (and certainly in the Samuel Presbiter manuscripts), this is rarely found in editions. Transcribing a medieval manuscript with its abbreviations can also save time and increase accuracy in transcription: by using text-expansion software, one can type, for example, ".spc" and receive the TEI `<expan><abbr rend="supraline">sp<am>c</am></abbr><ex>iritus</ex></expan>`{.xml}. Ultimately, the methodology of digital documentary editing allows us to produce editions much more quickly and accurate, in form that can be straightforwardly verified and corrected, and applied to a much wider range of research.

            <p>Hugh of St Victor’s <title>De quinque septenis</title> (<title>On the Five Sevens</title>) encapsulates the full scheme of the seven deadly sins in the high medieval period – today both widely recognized in popular culture and misunderstood. He links the vices with four other groups of seven: the requests of the Lord’s Prayer (using the version in Matthew 6:9–13), the gifts of the Holy Spirit (based on Isaiah 11:2–3), the virtues, and the beatitudes (Matt. 5:3–9).<note><p>Note that the beatitudes occur in a slightly different order from most English Bibles, and the Septuagint/Vulgate numeration of the Psalms differs from that of the Hebrew: all biblical references follow Robert Weber et al., eds., <title>Biblia Sacra iuxta vulgatam versionem</title>, 5th ed. (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2007).</p></note> Hugh’s accessibility and logic made it appealing to anyone wishing to teach these subjects, and the work was widely copied for the remainder of the Middle Ages.<note><p>One hundred manuscripts are listed in Rudolf Goy, <title>Die Überlieferung der Werke Hugos von St. Viktor: Ein Beitrag zur Kommunikationsgeschichte des Mittelalters</title>, Monographien zur Geschichte des Mittelalters 14 (Stuttgart: Hiersemann, 1976), 368–83; see also Morton W. Bloomfield et al., <title>Incipits of Latin Works on the Virtues and Vices, 1100–1500 A.D.: Including a Section of Incipits of Works on the Pater Noster</title>, Mediaeval Academy of America Publication 88 (Cambridge, MA: Mediaeval Academy of America, 1979), 407–8, <ref target="http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.31131.0001.001">http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.31131.0001.001</ref> (no. 4833); Richard Newhauser and István Bejczy, <title>A Supplement to Morton W.

Samuel Presbiter’s <title>De oratione dominica</title> is a versification of <title>De quinque septenis</title>, written around the turn of the thirteenth century.</p>
            <p>Hugh’s work has been printed many times; this article presents a documentary edition of Paris, Bibliothèque Mazarine, MS 717, representing the edition of Abbot Gilduin made shortly after Hugh’s death. <title>De oratione dominica</title> has never been studied or published, and survives in a single manuscript from Bury St Edmunds that was likely corrected by its author, now Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 115. Both works are here presented for the first time with an English translation.</p>

This success can be attributed in part to an organization that provided sustained promotion for his work – the Augustinian abbey of Saint Victor in Paris, founded in Hugh’s youth and surviving until its destruction during the French Revolution. The realization that our understanding of Hugh cannot be separated from his institutional context has produced something of a renaissance in studies on the Victorines and their school.<note><p>The Victorines and the Augustinian canons are the subject of the Bibliotheca Victorina series of monographs. New editions and French translations of primary texts of Victorine authors have been presented in the series Sous la règle de saint Augustin, directed by the Institut de recherche et d’histoire des textes (IRHT); the Victorine Texts in Translation series is collecting new English versions. The study of Hugh himself is being revitalized through the new editions of his complete works produced through the Corpus Victorinum of the Hugo von Sankt-Viktor Institut in Frankfurt, and in the Corpus Christianorum by the IRHT.

                        <title>De quinque septenis</title>
                    </head>
                    <p><title>De quinque septenis</title> presents itself as a letter to a fellow monastic, responding to a request for an explanation of five groups of seven phenomena Hugh identifies in scripture. It is difficult to deduce anything concerning the situation in which this arose: nothing in the tone indicates whether it was a topic that arose in casual conversation with a friend, or an enquiry from a distant correspondent pressing for further detail on the subject. Hugh also writes on the subject in <title>De septem donis spiritus sancti</title> and <title>De oratione dominica</title> (the latter of which might have inspired the title of Samuel’s versification). Roger Baron suggests that the letter was a logical outgrowth from Hugh’s earlier work <title>De institutione nouitiorum</title>.<note><p>Roger Baron, <q>Hugues de Saint-Victor: Contribution à un nouvel examen de son œuvre,</q> <title>Traditio</title> 15 (1959): 276–78, <ref target="https://jstor.org/stable/27830387">https://jstor.org/stable/27830387</ref>.</p></note> <title>De quinque septenis</title> is an effective and focused tool for teaching and internalizing a practical aspect of salvation.</p>
                    <p>Hugh presents the five identified groups of seven as having an integral and logical relationship both within their own families and with the others, the vices successively breaking apart the person, which only God can amend.<note><p>Summarized in more detail in Boyd Taylor Coolman, <title>The Theology of Hugh of St. Victor: An Interpretation</title> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010), 69–73; Boyd Taylor Coolman, <q>Hugh of St. Victor,</q> in <title>The Sermon on the Mount Through the Centuries</title>, ed. Jeffrey P. Greenman, Timothy Larsen, and Stephen R. Spencer (Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, 2007), 59–80.</p></note> While Hugh claims that his subjects come from scripture, this is only loosely true of the vices, which occur in scripture but not together: their assembly is the result of a longer tradition beginning with Evagrius Ponticus and John Cassian.<note><p>Richard Newhauser, <q>The Capital Vices as Medieval Anthropology,</q> in <title>Laster im Mittelalter/Vices in the Middle Ages</title>, ed.

                    <p>Four of the five groups Hugh discusses had a precedent. Most readers would likely count eight or nine beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5:3–12): Hugh’s numeration of seven follows Augustine in <title>De sermo domini in monte</title> (<title>On the Sermon of the Lord on the Mount</title>), who argues that the eighth beatitude is merely a summary of the first seven; the ninth is not to be taken with the rest, since it dispenses with the impersonal construction and there is no specific blessing.<note><p><title>De sermo domini in monte</title> 1.10: Almut Mutzenbecher, ed., <title>Sancti Aurelii Augustini De sermone domini in monte libros duos</title>, Corpus Christianorum, series latina 35 (Turnhout: Brepols, 1967), 7–9.</p></note> He links these directly to the gifts of the Holy Spirit.<note><p><title>De sermo domini in monte</title> 1.11–12: Mutzenbecher, <title>Augustini De sermone domini in monte</title>, 9–13.</p></note> It is only natural that when Augustine reaches the Lord’s Prayer in his discussion of the Sermon on the Mount, he also links these petitions to his seven beatitudes.<note><p><title>De sermo domini in monte</title> 2.38: Mutzenbecher, <title>Augustini De sermone domini in monte</title>, 128–30.</p></note> It has been noted that Hugh might also have been inspired by one of the versions of the <title>Glosa</title> on Matthew, most versions of which reflect Augustine’s approach,<note><p>Odon Lottin, <q>La doctrine d’Anselme de Laon sur les dons du Saint-Esprit et son influence,</q> <title>Recherches de théologie ancienne et médiévale</title> 24 (1957): 290–91.</p></note> but Hugh almost certainly had direct access to Augustine’s work, since the abbey owned a copy written in the early twelfth century.<note><p>Gilbert Ouy, <title>Les manuscrits de l’Abbaye de Saint-Victor: Catalogue établi sur la base du répertoire de Claude de Grandrue (1514)</title>, Bibliotheca Victorina 10 (Turnhout: Brepols, 1999), 2:198 (CC 2).</p></note></p>
                    <p>While Hugh’s use of numbers might seem artificial to a modern audience – Hauréau, an influential nineteenth-century commentator on Hugh, derided him as <q>le Pythagore des théologiens</q><note><p>Barthélemy Hauréau, <title>Les œuvres de Hugues de Saint-Victor: Essai critique</title> (Paris: Hachette, 1886), 22, <ref target="https://archive.org/details/lesoeuvresdehugu00haur">https://archive.org/details/lesoeuvresdehugu00haur</ref>.</p></note> – their deployment as a mnemonic was common in the Middle Ages. Far from perfunctorily using numbers, Hugh applied them in a particularly practical and rigorous manner for improving the memory. In <title>De tribus maximis circumstantiis gestorum</title>, he encouraged students to use numbers mapped onto a grid to promote a spacial understanding of a subject, a particularly innovative and effective approach.<note><p>William M. Green, <q>Hugo of St. Victor: <title>De tribus maximis circumstantiis gestorum</title>,</q> <title>Speculum</title> 18, no. 4 (October 1943): 484–93, doi:<ref target="https://doi.org/10.2307/2853664">10.2307/2853664</ref>; translated in Mary J.

Samuel Presbiter’s <title>De oratione dominica</title> is one example of a paraphrase to promote memorization. One also finds a series of circular diagrams or <foreign xml:lang="la">rotae</foreign> that originated in the late twelfth century, some translated into the vernacular, some of which were directly influenced by Hugh;<note><p>Rehm, <title>Bebilderte Vaterunser-Erklärungen</title>, 20–26, 72–77.</p></note> one called by scholars the <title>Septenarium pictum</title> survives in at least a dozen copies.<note><p>Barry Taylor, <q>Past, Present and Future for Thirteenth-Century Wales: Two Diagrams in British Library, Cotton Roll XIV.12,</q> <title>Electronic British Library Journal</title>, 2013, 8–16, <ref target="http://bl.uk/eblj/2013articles/article13.html">http://bl.uk/eblj/2013articles/article13.html</ref>.</p></note> These acted as a supplement to Hugh’s text rather than replacing it, and new manuscript copies continued to be made until the end of the medieval period.

                    <p>The text of <title>De quinque septenis</title> found on fols. 210va–212rb is written in a single protogothic hand. The scribe usually joins prepositions such as <q>ab</q> to the following word. The text is moderately abbreviated, but the scribe usually writes out <q>anima</q> and <q>dominus</q> rather than using the standard contractions. It is contained within a single gathering: the catchword on fol. 211v was used for assembling the gathering, and does not indicate its end.<note><p>See the collation in Poirel, <title>Livre de la nature</title>, 40.</p></note> It opens with a blue two-line capital, with red penwork. A small amount of red ink matching the shade of the initial on fol. 212rb has been spilled on fol. 211ra. It has been corrected by at least one reader, distinguished by a hand with thin strokes. This might be a contemporary corrector working with the scribe, as most of the ninth line on fol. 211rb (beginning <q>subueniat saluatoris</q>) has been erased and rewritten in what appears to be the same hand, compressed in order to fit into the limited space. One paragraph mark has been added in the margin in plummet on fol. 210vb, dividing what could be conceived as the introduction from the rest of the work. A later annotator (designated B in the edition) has added six inline paragraph marks in addition to running labels in the margins highlighting the numbers in the text, and flags several key passages with a set of three dots and a vertical line.</p>

                    <p>Baron does not represent the Mazarine manuscript accurately: he indicates that it reads <q>ad inuicem</q> at fol. 210va rather than <q>abinuicem</q> (a variant he ascribes only to Va), <q>ipsi</q> (the reading of the PL) at fol. 211ra rather than <q>sibi</q> (not reported as a variant), and <q>docetur</q> at fol. 211vb rather than <q>donatur</q> (which he ascribes only to Va, H, and L). He arbitrarily classicizes many spellings. While his text superficially follows the punctuation of the manuscript, he freely modifies it, often detrimentally: for instance, on fol. 210vb, the sentence <q>Cur nisi … amittat</q> ends not with Baron’s question mark but more correctly with a simple <title>punctus</title>; Hugh has finished his interrogation of pride, and is now stating the force of its destruction. In fairness, it should be noted that the edition was published posthumously,<note><p>Baron, <title>Hugues de Saint-Victor. Six opuscules spirituels</title>, 41.</p></note> and some of these errors might not have occurred had Baron lived to see it through the press. While his choice of manuscript is good, it has more unique and potentially correct readings than he shows.</p>
                    <p>The present edition emends the manuscript only where required for sense. Only a few significant modifications to the text are necessary. At fol. 210vb, <q>se</q> is suppressed in <q>ab illuminante se auertitur</q>, reported by Baron as occurring only in the Mazarine manuscript. While it can be found in at least one other witness,<note><p>Monte Cassino, MS 387, as printed in Caillau and Saint-Yves, <title>Augustini Operum supplementum I</title>, 161.</p></note> the usage of the previous sentence indicates that this is an error. At fol. 211ra, <q>quatum</q> is replaced with <q>quantum</q>, and at fol. 211va, <q>uenerati</q> with <q>uenerari</q>: these corrections are also made by Baron but not reported. Prepositions are separated where appropriate in the regularized form of the edition.</p>

                <head>Samuel Presbiter</head>
                <p>Samuel Presbiter (fl. 1200) is known to history only through the preservation of his works in two volumes from the abbey library of Bury St Edmunds, now Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 115 and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 860 (<title>SC</title> 2723). His writings largely excerpt and versify earlier prose works. <title>De oratione dominica</title> is a versification of Hugh’s <title>De quinque septenis</title>. Extracts from Hugh’s prose are copied between the verses as a commentary, a format Samuel uses in several of his works. The change in title reflects a shift in focus. While the verses summarize each of the groups of five, there is a stronger focus on the Lord’s Prayer, and its worthy (<title>digna</title>) invocation. The result is an epitome of Hugh’s work, removing the frame of a letter, presenting the source material from the Sermon on the Mount more explicitly, and providing a series of verses that could be memorized in order to recall the full contents of the whole.</p>
                <p>All that is certainly known of Samuel’s life is his claim to have studied under William de Montibus, who taught at the cathedral school in Lincoln from the 1180s until some point before his death in 1213.<note><p>Andrew N.J.

                <p>The only overt indicators of chronology for these works are that <title>Ex auditis super psalmos</title> and <title>Ex diuersis auditis</title> reflect Samuel’s studies under William de Montibus, while <title>Ad habendam memoriam</title> was written after he left the school, according to the extended heading with which the work begins. The two <title>Ex speculo</title> works abridge the <title>Speculum Gregorii</title>, Adalbert of Metz’s epitome of Gregory the Great’s <title>Moralia in Iob</title>;<note><p>Unedited, but studied in Lorenzo Valgimogli, <title>Lo «Speculum Gregorii» di Adalberto di Metz</title>, Archivum Gregorianum 8 (Florence: SISMEL, 2006).</p></note> many copies of it existed in England, including one at Bury St Edmunds by the late twelfth century.<note><p>Richard Sharpe et al., eds., <title>English Benedictine Libraries: The Shorter Catalogues</title>, Corpus of British Medieval Library Catalogues 4 (London: British Library, 1996), B13.48a.</p></note> Samuel also refers to it in his paraphrase of Psalm 1 (for example, Bodley 860, fols. 4r, 5r) and <title>Ad habendam memoriam</title> (fols. 128v, 130r). These works are also his most mature: the marginal glosses reflect increased confidence to work directly with biblical texts as well as secondary theological works, and often amalgamate references to many titles rather than summarize a single source.</p>

                        <title>De oratione dominica</title>
                    </head>
                    <p><title>De oratione dominica</title> summarizes the entirety of Hugh’s system of five groups, typically beginning with an indication of which vice the request addresses, followed by the gift of the Holy Spirit given in response, the corresponding virtue that comes from this, and the resulting beatitude. Its hexameter verses are organized into eight stanzas: one introductory, and one for each of the requests in the Lord’s Prayer. In Samuel’s other writings, verses are frequently presented to be memorized in order to learn the details of a particular concept, and the intent is presumably the same for this work.</p>
                    <p>As the title suggests, Samuel shifts the primary focus to the Lord’s Prayer, with a subtle reforming stance. Hugh presents the prayer as the first step towards their elimination, and arguably the only one for which humans are truly responsible: but he begins with the vices, which rhetorically puts the emphasis on understanding the effects of the vices and how one might rid oneself of them. Samuel introduces a new emphasis in his verses: that the prayer must be <title>digna</title>, <q>worthy</q> or <q>appropriate</q>. When a person presents the prayer, everything else follows naturally, as long as it is done wholeheartedly and solemnly. <q>Et bene sonato felicia gaudia confert</q> (fol. 44v) – <q>And when he speaks well, he gathers the blessed joys.</q></p>
                    <p>The commentary to the verses is a direct abridgement of <title>De quinque septenis</title>, reorganizing the text and adding quotations of the Beatitudes. Samuel eliminates most of the details of the discussion concerning the effects of the vices. After quoting Hugh’s basic definitions of the correlation between the groups of seven, they are repeated for easier reference above the corresponding verse. The emphasis is placed on understanding the practical workings of the Lord’s Prayer, and not on the effects of vice. Connecting words such as <title>ergo</title> are usually removed from Hugh’s prose. The cumulative effect of these changes is to transform Hugh’s work into a more efficient and direct treatise that could be quickly internalized. One could memorize Samuel’s verses to remember the system, and refer to his text when necessary to find the most useful passages from Hugh. While his text survives in only one manuscript, Samuel was not the only reader to look for better ways to navigate <title>De quinque septenis</title>, and indeed in Mazarine 717 marginal labels have been added to make it easier to refer to the text.</p>
                    <p>In many ways, <title>De oratione dominica</title> would be most helpful to someone who had already read Hugh’s text. Yet while it can be seen from the list of Samuel’s works that he is normally careful to cite the sources he uses, <title>De oratione dominica</title> is an exception: he does not give any indication that it is copied from another source. This is typical of the intellectual culture of the Middle Ages, in which there was immense freedom to adapt the writings of others. This sometimes leaves today’s readers, unfamiliar with the writings of the period, with the concern that medieval writers intended to pass off the work of others as original. It might be argued that Samuel’s audience would have been so familiar with the work that they would recognize the source immediately. He might have had access to a copy of <title>De quinque septenis</title> at either Lincoln or Bury St Edmunds: three copies of the work survive in the library of Lincoln Cathedral, two from the twelfth century and one from the thirteenth;<note><p>Rodney M. Thomson, <title>Catalogue of the Manuscripts of Lincoln Cathedral Chapter Library</title> (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Brewer, 1989), 41 (no. 58, art. 6.18), 163 (no. 201, art. 71), 201 (no. 241, art. 9).</p></note> Bury St Edmunds owned at least two copies, from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.<note><p>M.R. James and Ellis H. Minns, <title>A Descriptive Catalogue of the Manuscripts in the Library of Pembroke College, Cambridge, with a Hand List of the Printed Books to the Year 1500</title> (Cambridge: University Press, 1905), 9, doi:<ref target="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511692796">10.1017/CBO9780511692796</ref> (no. 9), 83 (no. 90).</p></note> In <title>Ex diuersis auditis</title>, Samuel’s citations function to remind the reader of the authority of the texts he uses, and not to provide a location where the original might be found. He normally gives some form of attribution to biblical and classical sources, but the few references to works written within the preceding century are mostly integrated without comment. Hugh had been dead for little more than half a century when Samuel was writing, and his reputation was still rising. It was only the biblical sources that needed to be identified in order to communicate the subject at hand, and Samuel enhanced the citation of these over Hugh’s original.</p>
                    <p>Whereas many of Samuel’s other works were written in Leonines, which use an internal rhyming scheme, <title>De oratione dominica</title> is composed in unrhymed hexameter, usually but not always with a caesura in the third foot. The syntax is not complex. They are not particularly artful, but they are highly serviceable.</p>
                    <p>It is tempting to dismiss Samuel as a mere excerpter,<note><p>Josiah Cox Russell, <title>Dictionary of Writers of Thirteenth-Century England</title>, Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research, Special Supplement 3 (London: Longmans, 1936), 147 (s.v. <q>Samuel Presbyter</q>).</p></note> or as Brian Twyne thought, little more than a devotee of William de Montibus.<note><p><q>Qui Gulielmi de Monte celeberrimi suo tempore Oxoniae theol. professoris auditor diligens et admirator extitit.</q> Quoted in Thomas Tanner, <title>Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica, siue, De scriptoribus, qui in Anglia, Scotia, et Hibernia ad saeculi XVII initium floruerunt, commentarius</title>, ed. David Wilkins (London: Bowyer, 1748), 651.</p></note> Samuel himself provides some idea of his motives behind his work. The opening folios of both Pembroke College, MS 115 and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 860 contain a text written as a <title>distinctio</title> in red ink, forming hexameter lines that can be read in four different ways:</p>

                    <p>These passages are highly characteristic of Samuel’s intellectual milieu. Their presence indicates that these two manuscripts were planned together in the form in which they have survived. These are collections of earlier units: Bodley 860 is a composite of three booklets, while Pembroke College 115 can be divided into two parts. Similar to the way in which Mazarine 717 represents a conscious effort to assemble the works of Hugh of St Victor, the Bury manuscripts are an attempt to provide Samuel’s writings in a presentable form, in this case with the author’s own involvement.</p>

The cancelled leaves between fols. 46 and 47 would presumably have been blank, as is fol. 46v: the contents are uninterrupted. The second booklet corresponds to <title>Collecta ex speculo beati Gregorii sine uersibus</title>, which has different ruling (in plummet rather than pencil) and a simpler scheme of decorated capitals from the rest of the volume. The same fashion of the final booklet of Bodley 860, the order of the internal pages of most gatherings are designated by letters, and a number (·i· through ·ix·) is found at the end of each gathering at the bottom of the page, in the centre, written in ink.</p>
                    <p>While the page layout is visually similar to Bodley 860, the ruling pattern differs slightly. In the Pembroke manuscript, the line spacing is variable, generally leaving 4.5 mm for prose and 7 mm for verses. This appears to have been done before the page was copied, and where this was not correctly planned, either the verse has to span two lines or a 7 mm line is subdivided for two shorter lines of prose. This can be seen, for example, on fol. 6r. The lines of the prose passages in Bodley 860 are similarly 4.5 mm high, but two full lines (9 to 10 mm) are left for the verses, simplifying the page preparation process.</p>

                    <p>The evidence suggests that Samuel was involved personally in the production of Pembroke College 115 and Bodley 860, with a correcting hand found in both manuscripts. This corrector is intimately familiar with the text, and seems to have gone through it methodically after it was copied; he leaves a faint note in the lower corner of MS Bodley 860, fol. 103r that reads <q>usque hunc in parte</q>. Its contemporaneity is demonstrated by fol. 39r, where one also finds additional verses copied into the margin, in turn recopied by a contemporary scribe imitating the original hand. The correction has been trimmed in binding, and as the manuscript appears to be in its original medieval binding, this was probably done at the time of production. While this correction might have been caught by anyone working with the exemplar, the same hand also makes original revisions to the text. The corrector is also highly interested in detail, extensively revising the punctuation (often, for instance, changing a <title>punctus</title> to a <title>punctus eleuatus</title>). The most likely identity for this corrector is Samuel himself.</p>

                    <head>Editing <title>De oratione dominica</title></head>
                    <p>As Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 115, fols. 41v–44v is the sole witness to <title>De oratione dominica</title>, and it has never been previously edited, a documentary edition of this manuscript encapsulates the full known material evidence of this text. In this situation, one of the best things that an editor can do is to create an edition that can be cited in the same way as the manuscript. For instance, while Baron’s edition of Mazarine 717 cites the folio and column breaks (though a few are missing), the only possible method of referring to a more specific passage in Hugh’s text is to use the line numbers in Baron’s own edition. Some scholars have instead chosen to refer to the Patrologia Latina columns (not included in Baron edition) and use Migne’s text. By instead recording the position of line breaks in the manuscript, one can maintain the citation systems that already exist, and refrain from perpetuating a new scheme. This is, indeed, a necessity for the flexible layout of electronic texts, where stable references must refer either to a physical object or a semantic division.</p>
                    <p>One of the problems of <title>De oratione dominica</title> (like all of Samuel’s verse-prose compilations) is that its layout does not fit with a key modern assumption of how a book should work: one cannot start reading at the top of the page and scan to the bottom. Instead, the text begins with the commentary, which is pared with the applicable line of verse below it. The commentary is far longer than the verses, meaning that the individual verse of the poem must be searched out over the entire text. In a printed version of this text, an editor would be forced to choose between rearranging the text to promote readability, and bringing the reader to the original – maintaining the ability to cite the manuscript by folio, the possibility of making better historical inferences about how readers might have used the text, and the prospect of experiencing non-linear habits of reading. This is only possible by relying on semantic categories rather than typographical conventions to interpret the text (for example, explicitly marking a line as verse rather than simply displaying it in enlarged type), and displaying the text in both documentary and regular forms. This is a distinct advantage of presenting texts in a digital format.</p>
                    <p>While the verses of <title>De oratione dominica</title> do not require emendation, its rendition of Hugh’s prose is much less accurate. The text is slightly different from that of Mazarine 717, including a few variants recorded by Baron, though not corresponding to any one of his manuscripts. The manuscript’s punctuation has been retained with some minor corrections, but the capitalization is partially editorial. It was a common scribal practice in this period to use capital letters only to indicate the beginning of a sentence: this is the generally the rule for Pembroke 115, and the edition attempts to preserve this, but the script’s execution leaves ambiguity between many majuscule and minuscule characters.</p>
